# Assignment 19 â€“ React Homework: Employee Directory

## Overview

In this assignment, I created an employee directory with React. The assignment required me to break up the application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.

## User Story

```
AS a user, 
I WANT to be able to view my entire employee directory at once, 
SO THAT I have quick access to their information.
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a table of random users, 
WHEN the user loads the page, 
THEN a table of employees should render. 

WHEN the user clicks on the sort button of a particular column,
THEN that items in that column are sorted in ascending order.

WHEN the user types an employee's name into the input bar,
THEN the data on that particular employee is filtered from the table.
```
